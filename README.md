This repo was for attending 2018's 104 hackathon. This was the first hackathon I attended. From this event, I learned other team's anaytics skills such as dividing a searching item into more searching items to increase a more accurate rate.

Second, this hackathon needed to start as early as possible. It is not possible to have new ideas in the hackathon event. 90% work needs to be done in advance.
